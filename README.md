# 🛡️ RMF SSP & POA&M Demo

This project demonstrates my understanding of the Risk Management Framework (RMF), NIST 800-53 Moderate baseline controls, and federal system compliance documentation. The materials simulate an RMF Package for a logistics system hosted in the Azure Government Cloud.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project showcases my ability to:
- Author RMF artifacts aligned with DoD compliance workflows
- Apply NIST SP 800-53 Moderate baseline controls in a simulated environment
- Track remediation efforts through a formal POA&M process
- Communicate clearly and professionally using industry-standard documentation

## 🔗 Why It Matters

As a senior cybersecurity student with Security+ certification and hands-on experience in vulnerability management and Azure-based security operations, I am well-prepared to support roles like Product Security Engineer. This project aligns directly with real-world expectations at organizations such as Boeing that require strong RMF knowledge, compliance documentation, and system hardening skills.
