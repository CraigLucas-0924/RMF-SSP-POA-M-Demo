## 🎯 Purpose

This project showcases my ability to:
- Author RMF artifacts aligned with DoD compliance workflows
- Apply NIST SP 800-53 Moderate baseline controls in a simulated environment
- Track remediation efforts through a formal POA&M process
- Communicate clearly and professionally using industry-standard documentation

## 🔗 Why This Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to create RMF documentation aligned with NIST SP 800-53 controls—key skills for cybersecurity roles supporting federal systems. By authoring an SSP and POA&M, I show readiness to support ATO processes, address security control gaps, and contribute to continuous compliance efforts in regulated environments.
